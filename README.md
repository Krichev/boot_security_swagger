# boot_security_swagger
this project uses javax websocket implementation, so there are some aditional clsses for configuration WS, 
WebSocketConfiguration, for register websocket class and SpringContext, which injects class in WS  
so @Autowire can work (will be removed by BPP)
in future version will be added ssl support
